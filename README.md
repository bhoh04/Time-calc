# Time Calculator GUI

This Python script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for the time calculation function implemented in the `time_calc.py` script. It allows users to input a start time, a time to add, and an optional day, and then calculates the resulting time.

## Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure that both `gui_time_calc.py` and `time_calc.py` are in the same directory.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the `gui_time_calc.py` script.

3. Run the script by executing the following command:

python gui_time_calc.py

4. A window will open with the Time Calculator GUI.

5. Enter the start time, time to add, and optionally the day in the respective input fields.

6. Click the "Calculate" button to see the result of the time calculation displayed in the GUI.

## Example

Suppose you want to calculate the time 2 hours and 30 minutes after 9:45 AM on a Tuesday:

- Start Time: 9:45 AM
- Time to Add: 2:30
- Day: Tuesday

The result will be displayed in the GUI.
